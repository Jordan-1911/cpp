/**
 * INTRO TO DATA TYPES
 *
 * - Recap: variables are names for a piece of memory that can be used to store information. Computers have RAM that is available for programs to use. When a variable is defined, a piece of memory is set aside for that variable
 * 
 * - BINARY DIGIT
 * -- the smallest unit of memory is a binary digit or a bit
 * -- a bit can hold a value of 0 or 1
 * -- Like a light switch, either the light is OFF (0),
 * or the light is ON (1)
 * -- there is no in between. If we were to look at a random segment of memory, all we would see is 011010101100 or some combination thereof
 * 
 * - memory is organized into sequential units called memory addresses or addresses for short
 * -- this is similar to how a street address can be used to find a given house on a street, the memory address allows us to find and access the contents of memory at a particular location
 * 
 * - in modern computer architectures, each bit does not get its own unique memory address. This is because the number of memory addresses is limited, and need to access data bit-by-bit is rate. Instead, each memory address holds 1 byte of data.
 * 
 * - BYTES
 * -- a byte is a group of bits that are operated on as a unit. The modern standard is that a byte is comprised of 8 sequential bits.
 * 
 * For illustration:
 * 
 * Address 3 ---- 11101000
 * Address 2 ---- 00000000
 * Address 1 ---- 10010111
 * Address 0 ---- 01101001
 *
